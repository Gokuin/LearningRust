# LearningRust
Dipping my toes into Rust
This repo is me diving into teachign myself a new language. I'll be working through the book and doing the exercises as I go.

## Current Projects in repo
- HelloWorld : a self explanatory program
- back_end_project : my attempt at wiring together RUST, PostGres DB, SQL , as well as postman , and some front end (Probably React) to show case my abilities.
- Hello_cargo : learning to use cargo in RUST to manage project creation
- Variables: a program built out of examples from chapter 3 of the textbook to show all that rust can offer for data types / manipulations for them.
- Guessing_Game : a simple program that takes a user input for a number guess and tells if too low, too high or a right guess.

### NOTE: If you have any questions or see a better way to do something i'm doing in my code please feel free to reach out.
